# Bake-off 1: Timebanking App

## Overview
This project involves creating a graphical interface for a mobile application (app) of a Timebanking system. Timebanking is a mutual aid system where members exchange services, with time as the currency. The goal is to design a high-fidelity prototype implemented in figma.com that enables users to: i) Browse service requests in the Timebank; ii) Request a new service from the Timebank; and iii) Offer a new service to the Timebank.

## Challenge
The challenge is to create a user-friendly, visually appealing interface for a Timebanking mobile app that facilitates the exchange of services between community members. The app should support functionalities such as browsing service requests, requesting new services with customized time costs, and offering new services with customizable details.

## Requirements and Tasks
- **Design:** Open-ended iterative design process from ideation to prototyping and testing.
- **Tasks:** Design and evaluate at least two iterations of the prototype, transitioning from Low-Fidelity Prototype (LFP) to High-Fidelity Prototype (HFP), using techniques covered in lectures.

### Functionality and Tasks
1. **Functionality:** Browse service requests in the Timebank.
   - **Task:** Identify the most expensive service request in terms of time cost.

2. **Functionality:** Request a new service from the Timebank with a customized time cost (in hours).
   - **Task:** Request a service to mow 200mÂ² of grass with a cost of 2 hours.

3. **Functionality:** Offer a new service to the Timebank with customized time, location, and date.
   - **Task:** Post a new offer in the Timebank for dog walking in the Beato parish for 1 hour on March 10, 2023.

### Recommendations
- Begin with Low-Fidelity Prototyping (LFP) using office supplies like paper, cards, and post-its for rapid iterations.
- High-Fidelity Prototypes (HFP) should focus on layout, user flow, and screen design without implementing backend functionality.

## Resources and Tools
- **Tools:** Figma (www.figma.com) for HFP.
  - Phone > Android Small (360 x 640) frame and test with 100% zoom.
